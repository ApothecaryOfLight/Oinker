# Oinker

A Twitter clone.



## GOAL

Oinker will be a Twitter look-alike, with many of the features of Twitter such as: posting, liking, following, notifications, private messages, photo uploads, and profiles.


This will be achieved with MySQL as the database, NodeJS as the backend, and HTML/CSS/Javascript/React as the frontend and Nginx as the reverse proxy.


No provisions will be made for scaling or indefinite usage: this project is intended to support at most a few thousand simultaneous users and at most a few hundred-thousand posts before facing significant slow-downs or even outright shutdown.
